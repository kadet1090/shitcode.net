        Shitty code can occur almost everywhere, on every moment of your life,
        <a href="http://shitcode.net">shitcode</a> is place for storing (And sharing too!) worst of our programming
        nightmares. Created as weekend project (So it's shitty as well) because... why not?

        So if you have some shitty project or code and want to share it go ahead and do that.
